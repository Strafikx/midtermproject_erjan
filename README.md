Hi everyone!
Here's my version of game of life called "Cancer+Vacine"

Nowadays, there are a lot of people with cancer and it is very difficult for them to recover (it all depends on the phase).

I made a simulation of cancer cells and anti-cancer drugs.

The main point is that the drug is administered in an amount of 20 cells and many of them instantly freeze (work only if the cancer cell itself steps on them) Only some drug cells begin to actively fight cancer cells. But as it most often happens, in the end, there are small remnants of cancer cells, and the chance that they will die is very, very small (for this, two drug cells must step on neighboring cells from each other while on cancer cells)

Cancer cells work according to the Game Of Life simulation concept, due to which, they additionally destroy themselves, but also create new ones
 
Also, most often, the active cells of the drug leave the injection site and sometimes return, or they may disappear forever, which ultimately shows that the drug most often does not cure the body completely!
